# Homework-1-code-refactor

## This project was refactoring a website to help make it more accessible as well as helping the css become less dry and the html be read more easily.

    My motivation for this project was to get a better understanding of how css and html work together to create a working and aesthetically pleasing website.  I sought out the knowledge of how different css elements would affect my overall webpage based off of their classes, ID's, and formatting.  I built this project with those goals in mind, hoping to be a better developer than I was at the beginning of this course.  I made the css less dry than it was before by combining multiple repetitive elements.  I also added semantic elements into the html so that it was not just all div classes.  I learned how to make my css flow in an orderly fashion and allow multiple elements of my html to be affected by a singular css command.  This project was extremely daunting to me at first but thanks to the instructors of this course i was able to gain a grasp on the information needed to make this project my own.
